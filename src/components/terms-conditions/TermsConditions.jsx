          <p>2. Eligibility and Use of Website</p>
          <p>
            The website and services offered by Defy Aerospace are intended for

            out under your account comply with applicable laws and regulations.
            We reserve the right to suspend, restrict, or terminate accounts or
            services at our discretion, without obligation to provide prior
            notice or explanation. Any unauthorized use of this website,

            violation of applicable copyright and intellectual property laws,
            and legal action may be taken.

            services must be made in full before access is granted. Fees are
            non-refundable unless explicitly stated otherwise in a separate
            refund policy. In the event that a candidate is unable to attend the
            course for any reason, a one-time transfer to the next available
            batch of their choice may be permitted, subject to seat availability
            and administrative approval. Any payments made via third-party
